## What is this?

This document exists thanks to a talk given by Alex Witherspoon to the #digitalAF team in 2021. The idea 
is to create a document that explains myself & the world of work. 

## About Me

I live in Ottawa, ON. I used to play a lot of basketball back in highschool. I am now an entrepreneur in the tech industry. 

I love computers and have built and modified the parts to them to make it a powerhouse.

## Personal Principles and Values

I believe in:

1. Doing what you love
2. Being open and authentic
3. Productivity & efficiency
4. Following your dreams
5. A healthy mind and body - Yoga!
6. Creating your own blueprint for life

## One-on-ones

I take and recieve criticism well and like giving advice as a mentor. Anything from my work experiences to my life experiences.
I am happy to help and nurture you as an individual.


## Teamwork Preferences

I like it when we are all on the same page and open & honest communication takes place. I like getting to the root of the 
problem and fixing the root cause rather than mending the superficial aspects.

I also like when we all win as a team!

## Technical Preferences

I love to code and Ruby on Rails has been my go-to framework for web applications. I have been in the Rails community
for about 7 years now. 

Tech Stack:
Mac OS or Windows (WSL2), bash, Ruby on Rails, AWS, Digital Ocean, Docker, Erlang/Elixir/Phoenix, Angular

## Feedback

I appreciate timely and relevant feedback. I appreciate people who take the time to formulate it in a way 
that is actionable and understandable.

I appreciate feedback that is anchored in being the best and doing the best.

Feel free to PR here to:

a) let me know something I've got wrong
b) let me know something else that is overwhelmingly me that I've missed!

## Things That *Really* Bug Me

1. Not resolving the root of the issue.
2. Not following through on what you believe / say.
3. Poor communication.

## Other Thoughts

I like a wide array of music and making it. It has always been a passion of mine.
